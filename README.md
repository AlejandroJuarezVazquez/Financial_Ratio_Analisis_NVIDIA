# Financial_Ratio_Analisis_NVIDIA
In this project, I show Financial Ratios and their formulas from the last 4 fiscal years from Nvidia, one of the biggest and most important companies in the world nowadays.

# Financial Ratios
The results from the analysis are the following:

## **Liquidity**

**1.Current Ratio (Razón de Efectivo)**

Even though we can see a slight diminution on the ratio from 2023 to 2024, it is higher than 1, meaning NVIDIA has a solid capacity to cover its current debts with current assets.

**2.Quick Ratio (Prueba Ácida)**

This ratio shows a diminution from 8.68 in 2023 to 6.98 in 2024. Due to the excluded inventories from the ratio we can tell that even without them NVIDIA has enough cash and other current assets to cover its debts.

**3.Cash Ratio (Cash Ratio)**

This ratio shows a diminution from 4.01 in 2021 to 3.12 in 2024, which indicates the cash proportion is lower than before. It can be due to using it for operations, debt pay, or acquisitions.
**4.Working Capital to Total Assets Ratio (KTSA)**

This ratio has remained constant between 0.32 and 0.36 during this time. This suggests that NVIDIA keeps an equilibrated administration of its work capital depending on the structure of its assets.

## **Solvency**

**1.Debt Ratio (Razón de Endeudamiento)**

The debt ratio has decreased steadily from 0.39 in 2021 to 0.29 in 2024. We can see that NVIDIA is reducing its reliance on debt financing, as only 29% of its assets are funded through liabilities in 2024. This indicates a conservative approach to leveraging and strong financial health.

**2.Interest Coverage Ratio (Razón de Cobertura de Intereses)**

This ratio is exceptionally strong in 2022 and 2021, though no value is reported for 2024. A high interest coverage ratio suggests that NVIDIA has a significant capacity to meet its interest obligations. The company can comfortably handle its debt costs, reflecting low credit risk.

**3.Leverage Ratio (Apalancamiento)**

The leverage ratio has fluctuated, peaking at 6.96 in 2022 and dropping to 6.41 in 2024. This higher leverage ratio indicates that a larger portion of NVIDIA's assets is funded by equity. The slight reduction in 2024 suggests a more balanced approach to equity and debt financing.

## **Solvency**
